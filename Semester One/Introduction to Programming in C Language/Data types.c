        Definition: Data types in programming define the type of data that a variable can hold.
        Different programming languages support various data types, each designed to handle
        different kinds of data and operations efficiently.
        .
        // Basic
        1. Integer Types: Integer types are used to store whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero)
        without any decimal points.
        2. Floating-Point Types: Floating-point types are used to store numbers with decimal points.
        3. Character Types: Character types store individual characters, typically represented in ASCII or Unicode.
        4. The double data type in programming is used to represent floating-point numbers with double precision.
        .
        // More data type
        1. Boolean Type: Boolean types represent truth values, typically true or false.
        2. Arrays and Strings: Arrays store multiple elements of the same data type consecutively in memory.
        3. Pointers: Pointers store memory addresses of other variables. They allow dynamic memory allocation
        and efficient manipulation of data structures.
        4. Structs and Unions
            Structs: Collections of variables (of possibly different types) under one name in a structured manner.
            Unions: Similar to structs but can hold only one value at a time.

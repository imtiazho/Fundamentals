        Definion: Operators in programming are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values.
        They are the building blocks of programming logic, allowing you to manipulate data and control the flow of a program.
        Operators can be categorized into several types based on the operations they perform.
        .
        Arithmetic Operators given below
        Operator	    Description	        Example
        +	            Addition	        a + b
        -	            Subtraction	        a - b
        *	            Multiplication	    a * b
        /	            Division	        a / b
        %	            Modulus (remainder)	a % b
        **	            Exponentiation	    a ** b
        //	            Floor Division	    a // b
        .
        Comparison (Relational) Operators given below
        Operator	Description 	            Example
        ==	        Equal to	                a == b
        !=	        Not equal to	            a != b
        >	        Greater than	            a > b
        <	        Less than	                a < b
        >=	        Greater than or equal to    a >= b
        <=	        Less than or equal to	    a <= b
        .
        Logical Operators given below
        Operator	Description	    Example
        &&	        Logical AND	    a && b
        ||	        Logical OR	    a || b
        !	        Logical NOT	    !a
        .
        Assignment Operators given below
        Operator	Description	                Example
        =	        Assign	                    a = b
        +=	        Add and assign	            a += b
        -=	        Subtract and assign	        a -= b
        *=	        Multiply and assign	        a *= b
        /=	        Divide and assign	        a /= b
        %=	        Modulus and assign	        a %= b
        **=	        Exponentiate and assign	    a **= b
        //=	        Floor divide and assign	    a //= b
        .
        Bitwise Operators given below
        Operator	Description	    Example
        &	        Bitwise AND	    a & b
        `	        `	            Bitwise OR
        ^	        Bitwise XOR	    a ^ b
        ~	        Bitwise NOT	    ~a
        <<	        Left shift	    a << b
        >>	        Right shift	    a >> b
        .
        Increment and decrement operators
        Pre-Increment (++a) : Increments the value of a by 1, then returns the new value.
        Post-Increment (a++): Returns the current value of a, then increments the value of a by 1.
        Pre-Decrement (--b) : Decrements the value of b by 1, then returns the new value.
        Post-Decrement (b--): Returns the current value of b, then decrements the value of b by 1.

        Definition: In programming, a function is a block of organized,
        reusable code that performs a single action or a related group
        of actions. Functions provide a way to modularize programs by
        breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
        This helps in improving code readability, reusability, and
        maintainability.

        1. Definition: A function is defined with a specific name, and it
        can take input parameters and return a value. The syntax for
        defining a function varies by programming language.

        2. Calling a Function: Once a function is defined, it can be called
        or invoked from other parts of the code using its name and
        providing the necessary arguments.

        3. Parameters and Arguments: Parameters are the variables listed
        in the function's definition. Arguments are the actual values
        passed to the function when it is called.

        4. Return Value: Functions can return a value using the return
        statement. If no return statement is used, the function returns
        None (in languages like Python) or equivalent.

        5. Return Value: Functions can return a value using the return
        statement. If no return statement is used, the function returns
        None (in languages like Python) or equivalent.

        6. Scope: Variables defined within a function are in the local
        scope and are not accessible outside the function.

        7. Built-in vs. User-defined Functions: Most programming languages
        come with a set of built-in functions for common tasks, such as
        print(), len(), and sum(). Users can also define their own
        functions to meet specific needs.

        8. Recursion: Functions can call themselves, a concept known as
        recursion. This is useful for solving problems that can be broken
        down into smaller, repetitive sub-problems.
